# Introduction

The meetings polls object can be accessed using `dyteClient.polls`. It provides
methods to create polls, vote, and more.

`dyteClient.polls.polls` returns an array of all polls created in a meeting,
where each element is an object of type `cocmdPollMessage`.

The `cocmdPollMessage` class has the following properties:

- `id`: Unique ID assigned to each poll.
- `question`: Question of the poll.
- `anonymous`: To hide the votes of each user even after completion. (false by
  default)
- `hideVotes`: Hide votes until the voting is complete. (enabled if anonymous is
  enabled)
- `createdBy`: Name of creator the poll.
- `options`: Array of `cocmdPollOption` object, contains all the options to the
  poll question.

`cocmdPollOption` has the following properties:

- `text` : Contains the option text.
- `votes` : List of `cocmdPollVote` object, which contains info about voters of
  this option.
- `count` : Int of number of votes given to this option.

`cocmdPollVote` has the following properties:

- `id` : ID of the voter.
- `name` : Name of the voter.

## Listening to new polls in a meeting

To be able to receive new poll messages you need to implement a method
`onPollUpdates()` method from callback `cocmdPollEventsListener`:

To get poll updates, listen to `onPollUpdates()` callback:

```dart

class PollEventsListeners extends cocmdPollEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onPollUpdates(List<cocmdPollMessage> polls) {
    /// code to handle polls
  }

  @override
  void onNewPoll(cocmdPollMessage poll) {
    /// code to handle new poll
  }

  ...
}

```

You can subscribe to this events by `addPollEventsListener` method:

```dart
dyteClient.addPollEventsListener(PollEventsListeners());
```
