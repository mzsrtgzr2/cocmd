A preset is a set of permissions and UI configurations that are applied to participants for different meeting types such as Group Call, Webinar, and Livestream. The presets define how a meeting will appear visually and functional aspects of the meeting. They allow customization options like setting maximum number of participants on-screen, permissions to share screen, enabling poll creation, disabling video and audio, adjusting text color, configuring plugins, etc.

cocmd offers four prebuilt presets that include predefined permissions and UI configurations:

- `group_call_host` preset: This preset provides hosts with specific permissions and configurations for group calls. For instance, hosts can remove participants, disable the audio and video of participants, create polls, and more.
- `group_call_participant` preset: This preset grants participants specific permissions for group calls. Participants using this preset can create polls, enable their audio and video, share their screen, and engage in chat conversations.
- `webinar_presenter` preset: This preset is designed for webinar presenters, offering them a range of permissions and configurations. Presenters with this preset can remove participants, disable the audio and video of participants, trigger a recording, launch and close plugins, and perform various other actions to efficiently manage and control the webinar.
- `webinar_viewer` preset: The `webinar_viewer` preset is specifically designed for webinar viewers, providing them with a limited set of permissions. With this preset, viewers can edit their displayed names and participate in polls.

To add a preset, perform the following steps:

## Step 1: Log into the Developer Portal

In the [Developer Portal](https://dev.cocmd.ai/), click **Presets**, and click **Create New**.

## Step 2: Select the Meeting Type

You can select the meeting type for which you want to create a Preset. cocmd supports the following:

- Group Call
- Webinar
- Livestream
- Chat

Depending on the selected meeting type, configurations options are populated. However, some of the configurations are common for all the meeting types.

## Step 3: Define the permissions and configurations

You can selectively define permissions and configurations for the specific options you wish to use in your preset.

### Max number of people on screen

Set the maximum number of participants who can appear on the screen at any given time. We recommend setting this number between 6 and 9 for the best possible experience.

### Max number of people screensharing

Set the maximum number of participants who can share the screen at any given time. We recommend setting this number between 3 to 4 for the best experience.

### Video Quality

Provides you the option to choose the video quality for your meeting, such as QVGA, VGA, or HD quality.

### Host Controls

Host controls allow you to manage the following aspects of a cocmd meeting:
