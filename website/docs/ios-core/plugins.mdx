# Plugins

The meetings plugins can be accessed using `meeting.plugins`. It provides two
main objects, `all` which contains list of all Plugin objects in a
`cocmdMeeting`. And `active` list which contains plugins which are enabled and
are currently being used in this meeting.

## Playing with plugins

Plugins are webviews which can be added in any view. To be able to get webview
from cocmdPlugin one needs to first acivate a plugin. To do that all we need to
do is call `plugin.active()` which will trigger a callback in
`onPluginActivated()`. Similarly to deactivate a plugin one can call
`plugin.deactivate()` and that plugin will be deactivated in the meeting.

```swift
plugin.activate() // to activate a plugin
plugin.deactivate()   // to deactivate a plugin
```

## Active plugin

To check if a `plugin` is active or not in a meeting one can use

```swift
let isActive = plugin.isActive
```

## Listening to plugins in a meeting

To be able to listen to plugin events you need to implement a methods from
callback `cocmdPluginEventsListener`. You can subscribe to these events by calling
`meeting.addPluginEventsListener(dytePluginEventsListener: listener)`

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: cocmdPluginEventsListener {

  func onPluginActivated(plugin: cocmdPlugin) {
    // your code to handle plugin activation
  }

  func onPluginDeactivated(plugin: cocmdPlugin) {
    // your code to handle plugin de-activation
  }

  func onPluginFileRequest(plugin: cocmdPlugin) {
    // your code to handle plugin file request
  }

  func onPluginMessage(message: [String : Kotlinx_serialization_jsonJsonElement]) {
    // your code to handle plugin message
  }
}
```
