# Prerequisite

Before you begin, review and understand the
[Components Basics](/react-ui-kit/basics/components-basics).

The following components are critical for the meeting to function, if you are
not using `cocmdMeeting` and customizing the UI, you will need to render the
following components.

### cocmdParticipantsAudio

This component is required for audio playback. **You will not be able to hear
audio without this component**.

This component also displays a dialog if the browser throws an auto play error,
requiring user interaction to allow audio to be played.

```jsx
<cocmdParticipantsAudio meeting={meeting} />
```

### cocmdNotifications

This component is required for receiving notifications. If you don't have this
component, you won't be notified of events like network disconnection or poor
network.

```jsx
<cocmdNotifications
  meeting={meeting}
  config={{
    config: {
      // which notifications to show
      notifications: ['chat', 'participant_joined', 'participant_left'],
      // which notifications should have sounds
      notification_sounds: ['chat', 'participant_joined', 'participant_left'],
      // maximum number of participant joined sound notifications
      participant_joined_sound_notification_limit: 10,
      // maximum number of chat message sound notifications
      participant_chat_message_sound_notification_limit: 10,
    },
  }}
/>
```

### cocmdDialogManager

A component which handles all dialog elements in a component. This component is required for the following components to work:

- cocmdLeaveButton
- cocmdSettingsToggle
- cocmdBreakoutRoomsToggle
- cocmdMuteAllButton

This components depends on the values from `states` object.

```jsx
function Example() {
  const [states, setStates] = useState({});

  const setState = (s) => setStates((states) => ({ ...states, ...s }));

  return (
    <Row>
      <cocmdButton onClick={() => setState({ activeLeaveConfirmation: true })}>
        Show Leave Confirmation
      </cocmdButton>
      <cocmdDialogManager
        meeting={meeting}
        states={states}
        oncocmdStateUpdate={(e) => setState(e.detail)}
      />
    </Row>
  );
}
```
