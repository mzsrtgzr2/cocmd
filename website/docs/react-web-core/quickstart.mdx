# Quickstart

This quickstart shows how to incorporate live video and audio into your React application using cocmd's Core SDKs. Core SDKs offer comprehensive customization and branding capabilities, enabling you to create your own user interface (UI) from scratch, without having to deal with complex media layers.

## Objective

You'll learn how to:

- Install the cocmd SDK
- Initialize cocmd Client
- Connect to the meeting
- Go live!

## Before Getting Started

Make sure you've read the [Getting Started with cocmd](/getting-started) topic
and completed the following steps:

- Create a [cocmd Developer Account](https://dev.cocmd.ai/)
- Create [Presets](https://dev.cocmd.ai/roles-presets). cocmd also includes the
  following pre-configured presets for group call and webinar. You can simply
  use the default preset if you don't wish to create one.
  - webinar_viewer
  - webinar_presenter
  - group_call_host
  - group_call_participant
- Create a [cocmd Meeting](/api/?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting)
- [Add Participant](/api/?v=v2#/operations/add_participant) to the meeting
- Install [React 16.8](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html) or higher on your device

## Step 1: Install the SDK

You can install the package npm or Yarn.

```shell npm2yarn
npm install @dytesdk/react-web-core
```

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@dytesdk%2Freact-web-core.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@dytesdk%2Freact-web-core)

## Step 2: Initialize the SDK

To start, we need to initialize the libraries and wrap the application in the `<cocmdProvider />` component. Import the `cocmdProvider` from the `dytesdk/react-web-core`.

The `<cocmdProvider />` provides the necessary context for the various hooks to consume the `meeting` object as per their purpose. cocmd provides the following built-in hooks for your usage:

- `usecocmdClient()`
- `usecocmdMeeting()`
- `usecocmdSelector()`

For more information on hooks, see [Use Web Core Hooks](/react-ui-kit/using-hooks).

To initialize, call the `init()` method and pass the `authToken`. You can get the `authToken` using the [Add Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant).

```jsx
import { cocmdProvider, usecocmdClient } from '@dytesdk/react-web-core';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [meeting, initMeeting] = usecocmdClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    initMeeting({
      authToken: '<auth-token>',
      defaults: {
        audio: false,
        video: false,
      },
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <cocmdProvider value={meeting}>
      {/* Render your UI here. Subcomponents can now use the `usecocmdMeeting` and `usecocmdSelector` hooks */}
    </cocmdProvider>
  );
}
```

You can now use the `usecocmdMeeting` and `usecocmdSelector` hooks as required.

## Step 3: Connect to the Meeting

Now, you have established the connection with the cocmd meeting server successfully. Next step is to join the room and leave the room once the meeting is over.

```jsx
import { usecocmdMeeting, usecocmdSelector } from '@dytesdk/react-web-core';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import Room from './Room';

export default function AudioRoom() {
  const { meeting } = usecocmdMeeting();
  const roomJoined = usecocmdSelector((meeting) => meeting.self.roomJoined);

  useEffect(() => {
    meeting.self.on('roomLeft', () => {
      // handle navigation to other screen here after the user has left the room.
      alert("You've left the room");
    });
  }, [meeting]);

  return <Room />;
}
```

## Example

```jsx
import { usecocmdMeeting, usecocmdSelector } from '@dytesdk/react-web-core';

const Meeting = () => {
  // in case you want to use the whole meeting object
  const { meeting } = usecocmdMeeting();

  // in case you just want to use a `slice` of a meeting object
  // these are optimized so that re-renders only occur when the selected slice changes
  const messages = usecocmdSelector((meeting) => meeting.chat.messages);
  const activeParticipants = usecocmdSelector(
    (meeting) => meeting.participants.active
  );

  return <div>{/* render your UI */}</div>;
};
```
