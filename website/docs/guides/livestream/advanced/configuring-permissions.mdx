## Presets

A preset is a set of permissions and configurations that are applied to participants. They determine the look, feel, and behavior of a livestream participant, with options to set varied permissions, such as the ability to create polls or chat, control access for plugins, and more.

## Configuration

You can define the following permissions and UI configurations:

**Max number of people on screen**: Set the maximum number of participants who can appear on the screen at any given time. We recommend setting this number between 6 and 9 for the best possible experience.

**Max number of people screensharing**: Set the maximum number of participants who can share the screen at any given time. We recommend setting this number between 3 to 4 for the best experience.
