      <p>
        It is important to understand that you need to create two presets for
        livestreaming. One preset is used for the livestreaming <b>host</b> and
        the other preset is used for the livestreaming <b>viewer</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The host requires certain host controls such as the ability to Kick
        Participants, Mute Audio, Mute Video, and Pin Participant, as well as
        media permissions like Start Livestream and Admit or remove participants
        from the livestream. Ensure that youâ€™ve selected those permissions for
        the host.
