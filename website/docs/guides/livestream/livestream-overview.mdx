# Overview

Livestreaming is the real-time broadcasting of video or audio content over the internet, enabling viewers to watch and interact with events as they happen. It facilitates one-to-many communication, where a single source streams the content to multiple viewers or participants.

cocmd's live streaming enables the hosts and participants to engage and interact during the stream, creating an interactive live streaming (ILS) experience.
