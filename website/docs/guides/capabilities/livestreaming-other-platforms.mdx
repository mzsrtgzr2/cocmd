# Restream to Social Platforms

cocmd can restream your meeting to any platform that supports an RTMP
endpoint, such as YouTube, Twitch, or LinkedIn.

## Prerequisites

- [Create a meeting](/api?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting)
- [Add a participant](/guides/livestream/build-livestream-app#step-5-add-participants)

## Step 1: Initiate meeting recording

To enable restreaming of a cocmd meeting, you will first need to start recording the meeting. In the [Start recording a meeting](/api#/operations/start_recording) API, provide the `meeting_id` of the meeting you wish to restream.

## Step 2: Configure restreaming settings

In the same [Start recording a meeting](/api#/operations/start_recording) API, configure the restreaming settings.

Specify the desired **RTMP input URL** and **stream key** where you want the meeting video to be streamed.

:::info Note
Your stream key is generated when [creating a livestream](/guides/rest-apis/livestream-dyte-meeting#step-2-create-a-live-stream).
:::

For example, if you want to stream it to [restream.io](https://restream.io), do
the following:

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.dyte.in/v2/organizations/orgid/meetings/meetingid/recording \
  --header 'Authorization: APIKEY yourapi-key' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "liveStreamingConfig": {
        "rtmpUrl": "rtmp://live.restream.io/live/your-stream-key"
    }
}'
```

You may notice a few seconds of lag between the meeting and the stream.
