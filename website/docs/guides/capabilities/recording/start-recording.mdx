This topic explains how to use cocmd to implement composite recording.

Before getting started with this guide, we recommend that you read
[Getting Started with cocmd](/getting-started) to familiarize yourself with cocmd.

There are two ways to start a recording a cocmd meeting:

- Using the `record_on_start` flag when
  [creating a meeting](/api/?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting)
- Using the [Start Recording API](/api/?v=v2#/operations/start_recording)

cocmd stores recordings for a period of 7 days, after which they will expire and no longer be accessible. It is important to either download a copy of your recording or [set up storage](https://docs.cocmd.ai/guides/recording/custom-cloud-storage#set-storage-configuration) before the link expires.

:::info note

1. Our system does not currently support recordings of brief durations that are less than five seconds. In such cases, it is possible that the recording APIs may experience occasional failures. Due to limitations in encoding recordings of short duration, these failures may result in an ERRORED state.
2. Recording will stop if there are no participants in a meeting for 60 seconds.
3. There can only be one active recording of a meeting at any given time.
4. The average file size for one hour of recording is approximately 300MB.
5. Maximum recording time is 24 hours. Recording will automatically stop after
   24 hours have elapsed since the recording's start time. This option can be
   configured to any value up to 24 hours by passing the `max_seconds` parameter
   in the [start recording](/api/?v=v2#/operations/start_recording) API request.

## Using the `record_on_start` parameter

When [creating a meeting](/api/?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting), you can
specify the `record_on_start` parameter to start the recording as soon as someone joins the
meeting.

:::info Specify storage_config

If youâ€™re using this method to start the recording, you must specify the
`storage-config' using the [Developer Portal](https://dev.cocmd.ai/).

:::

### Request

Specify the `record_on_start` parameter. If this flag is true, then a recording
will be started as soon as a meeting starts on cocmd, i.e, when the first
participant joins the meeting.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.cocmd.ai/v2/meetings \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic NzcyNDMyYXNoZGphZDpkc2ZzZGFmc2FkZmFzZGZzZGY=' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "title": "Lorem Ipsum",
  "preferred_region": "ap-south-1",
  "record_on_start": true
}'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08",
    "preferred_region": "ap-south-1",
    "record_on_start": true,
    "created_at": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z",
    "updated_at": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z"
  }
}
```

## Using the Start Recording API

You can also start a recording using the
[Start Recording](/api/?v=v2#/operations/start_recording) API.

Specify the `meeting ID` of the meeting that you want to record.

Use the [Fetch all meetings](/api?v=v2#/operations/get_all_meetings) for an
organization or [Create a meeting](/api?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting) API to
get the meeting ID. The API returns a parameter called `id`, which is your
meeting ID.

### Request

```bash title="Calling Start Recording API"
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.cocmd.ai/v2/recordings \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic NzcyNDMyYXNoZGphZDpkc2ZzZGFmc2FkZmFzZGZzZGY=' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
