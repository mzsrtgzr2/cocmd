title: Publish Recorded File to Your Cloud Provider
sidebar_position: 10

You can pass an optional object `storage_config` in the start recording request
to publish the recording directly to your cloud provider. If a `path` is
specified, the recorded video will be stored there, otherwise the default is the
root of the directory.

The filename for recording will be the same as given in `output_file_name`.

:::info note

Ensure that the cloud keys you provide to cocmd APIs have only limited access.

## Set storage configuration

You can configure storage configs for cocmd Recordings in the following ways:

### Using the `storage_config` option in the Start Recording API

This allows for the most granular level of control, and lets you specify a
storage_config for a specific
[recording started](/api/?v=v2#/operations/start_recording) on a meeting.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.cocmd.ai/v2/recordings \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic NzBjNWQzOTEtNGJhYy00Y2YzLTk5MDctYmVjMjA1Nzk4YWRiOmQyNzBmYjJmOGNiNGUzZWY1MGI1' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "meeting_id": "97440c6a-140b-40a9-9499-b23fd7a3868a",
  "storage_config": {
    "type": "aws",
    "access_key": "your-access-key",
    "secret_key": "your-secret-key",
    "bucket": "your-bucket-name",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "path": "/"
  }
}'
```

### Set Storage Configuration Details Using Developer Portal

You can also specify storage configuration details using Developer Portal.

1. In the Developer Portal, go to Recordings.
2. Click **Setup Storage**.
3. Specify the details for your cloud provider. We support transferring
   recordings to AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets.

:::info note

If you have specified storage configuration in the
[Start Recording](/api/?v=v2#/operations/start_recording) APIs, it will take
precedence and override the storage details configured in the Developer Portal.

## Supported Cloud Providers

Currently, the following cloud providers are supported:

### AWS S3

To transfer recordings to the AWS S3 bucket, set the following fields in the
`storage_config` parameter:

- Type: Specify aws.
- Access Key: Enter your `aws_access_key_id`.
- Bucket: Enter your AWS S3 bucket name.
- (Optional) Path: Specify the path to a sub-folder where recordings should be
  transferred. If this parameter is not passed, recordings will be transferred
  to the root folder of the bucket.
- Secret: Enter your `aws_secret_access_key`.
- Region: Specify the region where your bucket is hosted, for example,
  `ap-south-1`.

### Azure Blob Storage

To transfer recordings to the Azure Blob Storage, set the following fields in
the `storage_config` parameter:

- Type: Specify `azure`.
- Access key: Enter your azure connection string. For more information on how to
  get the access key, see
  [View account access key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&tabs=azure-portal#view-account-access-keys).
- Bucket: Enter the name of your container. The container should be in the same
  storage account as the connection string.
- (Optional) Path: Specify the path to a sub-folder where recordings should be
  transferred. If this parameter is not passed, recordings will be transferred
  to the root folder of the container.
- Secret: Set to a blank string "".
- Region: Set to a blank string "".

### DigitalOcean

To transfer recordings to the DigitalOcean Spaces, set the following fields in
the `storage_config` parameter:

- Type: Specify `digitalocean`.
- Access key: Enter your digital ocean access key. For more information, see
  [Create DigitalOcean Space and API Key](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-digitalocean-space-and-api-key).
- Bucket: Enter the name of your Spaces bucket.
- (Optional) Path: Specify the path to a sub-folder where recordings should be
  transferred. If this parameter is not passed, recordings will be transferred
  to the root folder of the container.
- Secret: Enter your Spaces secret.
- Region: Specify the region where your Spaces bucket is hosted, for example,
  `SGP1`. For more information, see
  [Region Availability Matrix](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/platform/availability-matrix/).

### Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

To transfer recordings to GCS, set the following fields in
the `storage_config` parameter:

- Type: Specify `gcs`.
- Bucket: Enter the name of your Cloud Storage bucket.
- (Optional) Path: Specify the path to a sub-folder where recordings should be
  transferred. If this parameter is not passed, recordings will be transferred
  to the root folder of the container.
- Secret: Enter your service account credentials. For more information, see [service account credentials](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#service-account).
- Region: Specify the region where your Cloud Storage bucket is hosted, for example,
  `US multi-region`. For more information, see
  [Bucket locations](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations).

## Update the Recording File Name

You can change the name of the recording file using the `file_name_prefix` field. The default format for recorded file name is `roomname_timestamp`, but you can add an alphanumeric and underscore prefix to the default file name.

It's important to note that you can only add a prefix to the default format; you can't change the entire file name. For example, if you teach an online physics class at 9 a.m. using cocmd, you could add `Physics_9am` to the file name. `Physics_9am_roomname_timestamp` would be the new file name.

For more information, see [start recording a meeting](https://docs.cocmd.ai/api#/operations/start_recording).
