# Introduction

The meeting chat object is stored in `dyteClient.chat`, which has methods for
sending and receiving messages. There are 3 types of messages that can be sent
in chat - `text`, `images`, and `files`.

The `dyteClient.chat.messages` array contains all the messages that have been
sent in the chat. This is an array of objects, where each object is of type
`cocmdChatMessage`.

The `cocmdChatMessage` class has the following properties:

- `userId` : UserID of the sender.
- `displayName` : Display name of the sender.
- `read` : Boolean whether the message is read or not.
- `pluginId` : Plugin ID of the message.
- `type` : `cocmdMessageType` for type of message being sent (whether
  `cocmdMessageType.text`, `cocmdMessageType.image` or `cocmdMessageType.file`).

There are 3 message classes that extends `cocmdChatMessage`, and each has some
extra parameter apart from `cocmdChatMessage` ones:

- `cocmdTextMessage`
- `cocmdImageMessage`
- `cocmdFileMessage`

#### cocmdTextMessage:

- `message`: Text message sent.

#### cocmdImageMessage:

- `link`: URL to the bucket where the image is stored.
- `fileUri`: Local path URL of image selected.
- `fileName`: Name of image selected.

#### cocmdFileMessage:

- `name`: Name of the file to be sent.
- `fileUri`: Local path URL of the file selected.
