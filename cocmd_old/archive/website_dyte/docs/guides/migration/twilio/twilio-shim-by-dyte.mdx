title: 'Migrate from Twilio to cocmd with Shim'

The Twilio [Shim](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)>) by cocmd is a package that allows you to migrate your video calling applications from [Twilio](https://sdk.twilio.com/js/video/releases/2.27.0/docs/index.html) to cocmd infrastructure.

- cocmd provides a set of shim libraries that serve as seamless replacements for the Twilio video APIs. These shims serve as a fundamental building block for migrating your real-time voice and video applications from Twilio to cocmd infrastructure.
- The `@dytesdk/twilio-shim` package serves as a wrapper over the cocmd SDK with an external API that is fully compatible with Twilio JS. As a drop-in replacement for Twilio JS, it can handle most of the methods and events that are present in the original library.

Please [contact us](https://cocmd.ai/contact) for any help or support with the migration.

## Start migrating from Twilio to cocmd with Shim

To get started with the cocmd Shim for Twilio, install the shim from the NPM Registry using the following command:

```bash npm
npm install @dytesdk/twilio-shim
```

## Usage

The `@dytesdk/twilio-shim` shares the same API as the Twilio video SDK. You can use most of the methods that are supported by it.

Here are some sample cases, and if you want to see a complete list of compatible features, see the [Twilio Shim: Supported Features](/guides/migration/twilio/compatibility-shim-twilio) page.

### Connect to a room

You can obtain cocmd authentication token `<DYTE-AUTH-TOKEN>` using the [Add a Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant).

```ts
const { connect } = require('@dytesdk/twilio-shim');

const authToken = '<AUTH_TOKEN_FROM_DYTE_API>';
const room = await connect(authToken, {audio: false, video: true});
console.log(`Successfully joined a Room: ${room.name}`);
console.log(room);
room.on('participantConnected', participant => {
console.log(`A remote Participant connected: ${participant}`);
});
```

### Add a participant

```ts
const { connect } = require('@dytesdk/twilio-shim');

const authToken = '<AUTH_TOKEN_FROM_DYTE_API>';
const room = await connect(authToken, {audio: false, video: false});
room.on('participantConnected', participant => {
    console.log(`Participant "${participant.identity}" connected`);

    participant.tracks.forEach(publication => {
        if (publication.isSubscribed) {
            const track = publication.track;
            document.getElementById('remote-media-div').appendChild(track.attach());
        }
    });

    participant.on('trackSubscribed', track => {
        console.log('Subscribed to track', track);
        const element = track.attach();
        console.log(element);
        document.getElementById('remote-media-div').appendChild(element);
    });
});
```

### Enable audio and video

```ts
const { connect } = require('@dytesdk/twilio-shim');

const authToken = '<AUTH_TOKEN_FROM_DYTE_API>';
const room = await connect(authToken, {audio: true, video: true});

room.localParticipant.audioTracks.forEach(publication => {
    publication.track.disable();
});

room.localParticipant.videoTracks.forEach(publication => {
    publication.track.disable();
});


// Enable audio and video tracks after 5 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
    room.localParticipant.audioTracks.forEach(publication => {
        publication.track.enable();
    });

    room.localParticipant.videoTracks.forEach(publication => {
        publication.track.enable();
    });
}, 5000);
```
