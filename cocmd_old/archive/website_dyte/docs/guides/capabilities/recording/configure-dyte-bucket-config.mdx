Once the recording is complete, by default, cocmd uploads all recordings to cocmd's S3 bucket in the AWS `ap-south-1` region. Additionally, a presigned URL is generated with a 7-day expiry. The recording can be accessed using the [`downloadUrl`](/api/?v=v2#/operations/start_recording) associated with each recording.

However, cocmd provides users with the flexibility to choose whether or not to upload their recordings to cocmd's S3 bucket. If you wish to disable uploads to cocmd's bucket, you can set the `dyte_bucket_config` parameter to false in the [Start Recording endpoint](/api/?v=v2#/operations/start_recording).

For example:

```json
{
  "dyte_bucket_config": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

:::info note

If you haven't specified an external storage configuration and also disabled uploads to cocmd's bucket, then the recording will not be uploaded to any location. It is considered as an invalid recording.

For more information on how to set your extrenal storage configuration, see [Publish Recorded File to Your Cloud Provider](/guides/capabilities/recording/custom-cloud-storage).
