A webinar is an interactive online event where individuals or organizations share information, deliver presentations, and engage with a remote audience over the internet. It involves a host or presenter who shares content or expertise with participants from different locations. Webinars offer features like live chat, polls, Q&A sessions, and audio/video interactions for active participant engagement. They are used for education, marketing, training, and other real-time online events.

## How cocmd's webinar is different from a group call?

Webinars and group calls serve distinct purposes and have different characteristics.

### Webinar

- Webinars are one-to-many events focused on sharing information to a larger audience.
- They involve presenters and viewers, with the presenter delivering content and viewers actively participating through features like chat and Q&A.
- In webinars, participants producing media (audio or video) are considered "on stage," while others are "off stage."
- cocmd provides prebuilt presets for webinar presenters and viewers, offering predefined permissions and UI configurations tailored to their roles. For more information, see [Add Presets](/guides/capabilities/presets).

### Group call

- Group calls in cocmd emphasize interactive communication and collaboration among a smaller group of participants.
- They enable real-time audio and video interactions for team meetings and discussions, promoting equal participation among all participants.
- cocmd provides prebuilt presets specifically designed for group calls, including the `group_call_host` and `group_call_participant` presets, which offer predefined permissions and UI configurations for hosts and participants. For more information, see [Add Presets](/guides/capabilities/presets).
