# Local User - Events

You can subscribe to various local user events:

- To subscribe, pass the instance of `LocalUserListener` class created above
  to `addSelfEventsListener()` method of `dyteClient` instance as follows:

```dart {2}
dyteClient.addSelfEventsListener(LocalUserListener());
```

- Implement `cocmdSelfEventsListener` to a class say `LocalUserListener`, and
  listen to event from `cocmdSelfEventsListener` by overriding them. This class
  can be user to manage your state in the application.

```dart
class LocalUserListener implements cocmdSelfEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onAudioDevicesUpdated() {
    /// code to handle onAudioDevicesUpdated() event
  }

  ...
}
```

### Video update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the video using `enableVideo()`/
`disableVideo()`, or host turns-off the video.

```dart
class LocalUserListener implements cocmdSelfEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onVideoUpdate(bool videoEnabled) {
    if(isVideoEnabled){
      // Video is enabled, other users can see the video.
    } else {
      // Video is disabled, others users can't see the video.
    }

  //  or alternatively you can pass the bool through state as demonstrated in example app.
  }

  ...
}
```

### Audio update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the audio using `enableAudio()`/
`disableAudio()`, or host mutes the audio.

```dart

class LocalUserListener implements cocmdSelfEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onAudioUpdate(bool audioEnabled) {
    if (audioEnabled) {
        // audio is enabled, and other participants in room can hear local user
      } else {
        // audio is disabled, and other participants in room can not hear local user.
      }

    //  or alternatively you can pass the bool through state as demonstrated in example app.
  }
  ...
}
```

### Room disconnected update

Triggered when the user is disconnected due to media or network errors

```dart

class RoomStateNotifier implements cocmdMeetingRoomEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onMeetingRoomDisconnected() {
    // Display a notification to the user indicating that they have been disconnected from the meeting.
  }
  ...
}
```

### Proximity changed

Triggered by any change in proximity, such as when the device is brought near or moved away from an earpiece, which triggers the display to turn on or off.

```dart

class LocalUserListener implements cocmdSelfEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onProximityChanged(bool isNear) {
    if (isNear) {
        // Display should be turned off, as user might be speaking through ear piece
      } else {
        // Display should be tunred on, as user might be looking at display and listening through speaker/earphones.
      }
  }
  ...
}
```

### Waitlist status

When the waiting room feature is enabled for a meeting, you can use the `onWaitListStatusUpdate()` callback function to receive updates on waiting room status changes.

```dart

class LocalUserNotifier implements cocmdSelfEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onWaitListStatusUpdate(cocmdWaitListStatus waitListStatus) {
    // cocmdWaitListStatus is an enum with the following values:
    // if `cocmdWaitListStatus.none`, user is not on the waitlist
    // if `cocmdWaitListStatus.waiting`, user is on the waitlist
    // if `cocmdWaitListStatus.accepted`, user has been accepted in the meeting.
    // if `cocmdWaitListStatus.rejected`, user has been rejected from the meeting.
  }

  ...
}
```

## Webinar request

When the local user receives a request to join the webinar, the `onWebinarPresentRequestReceived()` callback function is triggered. Similarly, when the local user stops presenting during the webinar, the `onStoppedPresenting()` callback function is triggered.

```dart
@override
void onWebinarPresentRequestReceived() {
  // Display an alert to the user, allowing them to accept or reject the request.


}

@override
void onStoppedPresenting() {
  // Display an alert to the user indicating that they are no longer presenting.
}
```

## Local user removed

When the local user is removed from the meeting, the `onRemovedFromMeeting()` callback is triggered.

```dart

@override
void onRemovedFromMeeting() {
  // Display an alert to the user indicating that they are no longer in the meeting.
}
```

## Listen to stage status changes

When the stage status of local user is updated, this event is triggered. It contains updated stage status as an argument.

```dart
@override
void onStageStatusUpdated(cocmdStageStatus status){
  // Update your UI as per this stage status.
}
```
