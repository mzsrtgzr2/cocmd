# Migrate to v2 REST API

cocmd v2 REST API is now the primary API for cocmd and the focus of development
efforts. The API has been redesigned to cater to a wider range of developer
requirements and to enhance the developer experience. With v2 endpoints you can
manage cocmd’s organizations, sessions, meetings, recording, webhooks,
livestreaming, analytics, and much more.

We highly recommend that you start migrating to v2, as v1 will eventually be
discontinued. However, rest assured that support for v1 will still be provided
for the near future.

## What’s new with cocmd v2 REST API

The cocmd v2 REST API includes a range of new features to help you get more from
the cocmd API.

### New endpoints

While the majority of the endpoints in cocmd API v2 are replacements, we have
introduced several new endpoints. Here are a few examples of new endpoints we've
added to v2:

- **Chat Replay**: Allows you to programmatically
  [retrieve all chat messages](https://docs.cocmd.ai/api#/operations/GetSessionChat)
  of a cocmd session.
- **Sessions**: Provides information about all
  [meetings](https://docs.cocmd.ai/api#/operations/GetSessions) that have taken
  place within your organization, including the list of participants, their
  details, and more.
- **Active session**: Provides details about an
  [ongoing meeting](https://docs.cocmd.ai/api#/operations/GetActiveSession),
  allows to mute participants, create polls, kick participants, and so on.
- **Livestreaming**: Enables you to
  [create a livestream](https://docs.cocmd.ai/api#/paths/livestreams/post), start
  livestreaming a meeting, and retrieve livestreaming details.
- **Analytics**: Provides complete
  [analytics data](https://docs.cocmd.ai/api#/operations/GetOverallStats) of an
  organization for the specified time period.
- **Organizations**: Allows you to
  [create](https://docs.cocmd.ai/api#/operations/createOrg) an organization,
  [view details](https://docs.cocmd.ai/api#/operations/getOrg) of an
  organization,
  [edit the details](https://docs.cocmd.ai/api#/operations/editOrg), and so on.
- **Participant token**: Allows you to
  [regenerate authentication token](https://docs.cocmd.ai/api#/operations/regenerate_token)
  for the given meeting and participant ID.
- **Presets**: Allows you to
  [delete](https://docs.cocmd.ai/api#/operations/delete-presets-preset_id) a
  preset.

### Improved performance

APIs are optimized for better performance resulting in:

- 71% improvement in adding participant time
- 89% improvement in response times for most endpoint
- Significant improvement in caching
- 32% improvement in analytics

### Authentication schema changes

The v2 APIs employ Basic authentication with the organizationId serving as the
username and APIKEY as the password.

`Basic ${base64encode(orgId + ':' + apikey)}`

### Preset changes

In v1 REST APIs preset is an optional requirement but you can set it at both the
meeting and participants level. In V2 preset can only be applied at participant
level, but it is a mandatory requirement.

### Pagination

All endpoints now support pagination. The responses to v2 APIs are paginated to
make them easier to handle.

### Enhanced structure

The structure of our API requests and responses has been improved, with
ambiguous terms and routes present in the v1 APIs being deprecated. The new APIs
are more intuitive to use and perfectly align with your specific needs.

### Consistency

A key feature of the updated v2 version of the cocmd API is consistency among
endpoints, which ensures uniform objects, functions, and behavior across similar
endpoints.

## Migrate to v2

To start the migration, do the following:

1. Log into the [Developer Portal](https://dev.cocmd.ai/).
2. In the **API Version**, select **v2** from the drop-down.
   <img
     src="/static/v2-API-migration/v2_selector.png"
     width="400"
     height="100"
     alt="v2 Selector"
     className="v2-switch"
   />

That’s all, you are in the v2 version.

In the v2 view of the Developer Portal, you can view and manage the meetings and
recordings that you have created using v2 APIs, as well as access and manage the
dashboard, API keys, logs, and webhooks.

cocmd also provides the option to copy your v1 presets to v2, which offers
greater flexibility.

### Copy v1 Presets to v2

To copy your v1 presets, do the following:

1. In the [Developer Portal](https://dev.cocmd.ai/), select **Presets**.
2. In **Presets**, click **Migrate from v1**. If you’re in the v1 view of the
   Developer Portal, click **Migrate to v2**.
   <img
     src="/static/v2-API-migration/Preset1.png"
     alt="Migrate Preset"
     className="v2-preset-migrate"
   />
3. Select all the presets that you want to copy to v2 and click **Migrate
   selected**. You can also copy all the presets by selecting **Select all**.

   <img
     src="/static/v2-API-migration/Preset2.png"
     width="300"
     height="200"
     alt="Migrate Preset All"
     className="v2-preset-selectall"
   />

4. Click **Done**. All the selected presets are copied to v2 as well.

By copying the chosen presets in v2, you can maintain consistent roles, UI
elements, buttons, and configurations for your participants in v2 meetings, just
as in v1 meetings.

:::info Note

It is important to understand that v1 and v2 are
distinct systems. You can not make API calls for v1 entities using v2 APIs.

Ensure that you are using v2 APIs only for all your v2 meetings. If you need to
create an organization using v1 APIs, please use v1 APIs only to create
meetings, add participants, and so on.

Although the v1 APIs will continue to function, we strongly recommend that you
transition to v2 APIs as soon as possible. The updated version offers several
enhancements, such as improved performance and additional capabilities.
Additionally, all future features will be exclusively developed for the v2 APIs.

### General guidelines

The migration process from REST API v1 to v2 can vary depending on the specific
use case, but here are some general guidelines:

- **Review changes in API endpoint and payload format**: Before making any
  changes, familiarize yourself with the changes in the endpoint URLs and the
  format of the payload data in API v2 compared to API v1.
- **Update API calls**: Update all API calls in your code to use the new API v2
  endpoints and payload formats.
- **Understand error codes** : Update error handling in your application for v2
  errors.

## Postman collection

We've provided a ready-to-use
[Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/dyte-api/workspace/dyte-s-public-workspace/collection/208979[…]8d7-8739-49ac-b88c-c5e6ec365e21?action=share&creator=20897959)
of relevant APIs to help you get started quickly with the new endpoints and
capabilities. This allows you to test authentication and experiment with
endpoints.
