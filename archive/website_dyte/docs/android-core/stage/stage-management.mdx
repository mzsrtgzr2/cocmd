# Manage Stage in cocmd's Group Call Meeting

In a group call, both hosts and participants can manage the stage. This allows for seamless control and organization of the session.

## Host stage management

In cocmd's group call platform, hosts have the capability to request participants to join the stage. When a host sends a request to a participant, the participant will receive a callback in the `cocmdStageEventListener#onPresentRequestReceived()` method. The participant can then choose to accept or decline the request using specific functions.

```kotlin
meeting.addStageEventsListener(object : cocmdStageEventsListener {
  ...
  override fun onPresentRequestReceived() {
    // when host requests this user to join stage. Here one should give choice to either accept the request or decline it.
  }
  ...
})
```

To accept the request and join the stage, participants can utilize the following command:

```kotlin
meeting.stage.join()
```

Alternatively, if participants wish to decline the request and not join the stage, use the following command:

```kotlin
meeting.stage.cancelRequestAccess()
```

## Participant stage management

Participants with the "Accept requests" setting enabled in the Preset can manage the stage in the webinar.

### Access the list of requests

To access the list of requests received to join the stage, you can utilize the `meeting.stage.accessRequests` API. This provides you with the necessary information about the participants who have requested to join the stage.

```kotlin
meeting.stage.accessRequests
```

### Listen to the incoming requests

Once you are in the meeting, you can register a listener in the meeting object to listen for incoming requests.

```kotlin
meeting.addStageEventsListener(object : cocmdStageEventsListener {
  override fun onPresentRequestReceived() {
    // when host requests this user to join stage. Here one should give choice to either accept the request or decline it.
  }

  override fun onAddedToStage() {
    // when this user is joined to stage
  }

  override fun onRemovedFromStage() {
    // when this user is no longer on stage
  }

  override fun onPresentRequestAdded(participant: cocmdStageParticipant) {
    // when a user is requesting to join the stage
  }

  override fun onPresentRequestClosed(participant: cocmdStageParticipant) {
    // when a user who was trying to join stage leaves the call.
  }

  override fun onPresentRequestAccepted(participant: cocmdStageParticipant) {
    // when a join stage request is accepted by host
  }

  override fun onPresentRequestRejected(participant: cocmdStageParticipant) {
    // when a join stage request is denied by host
  }

  override fun onPresentRequestWithdrawn(participant: cocmdStageParticipant) {
    // when a user who was trying to join stage withdraws their request to join.
  }
})
```

### Accept stage requests

To accept a request to join the stage, call the following function, where `ids` represents the list of unique identifier of the request.

```kotlin
meeting.stage.grantAccess(ids: List<String>)
```

### Reject stage requests

To reject a request, call the following function:

```kotlin
meeting.stage.denyAccess(ids: List<String>)
```

:::note
It's important to note that if a participant doesn't have the permission to perform these operations, the SDK will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`
:::

### Withdraw stage request

To withdraw a request to join the stage, call the following function:

```kotlin
meeting.stage.cancelRequestAccess()
```
