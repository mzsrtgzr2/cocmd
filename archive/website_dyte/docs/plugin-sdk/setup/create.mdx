:::info prerequisites

- Ensure that cocmd CLI is installed on your machine. Run the command `dyte help`
  to verify. For more information on how to install cocmd CLI, see
  [Setup cocmd CLI](https://docs.cocmd.ai/cli).

- Create an account on the [cocmd Developer Portal](https://dev.cocmd.ai) if you
  haven't already.

### Steps to create your plugin

- You can use cocmd CLI to create your plugin.

  ```shell
  cd <your-project-directory>
  ```

  ```shell
  dyte plugins create
  ```

  This command asks you a bunch of questions and then generates a
  dyte-config.json for you. You can use this JSON file to
  [configure your plugin properties](/plugin-sdk/setup/customize). This file
  must always stay in the root of your folder.

- Use this command to verify if your plugin was created

  ```shell
  dyte plugins ls
  ```

### Next Step

Learn how you can use `dyte-config.json` to customize your plugin's name,
description, logo, build config and more.
