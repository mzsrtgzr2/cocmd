# Quickstart

This quickstart shows how to use cocmd's UI Kit prebuilt components to add live
video and audio to your React application with minimal coding and a variety of
meeting UI customization options.

cocmd also offers the flexibility to build your own UI using various individual
components. This offers limitless customization options to tailor the UI to fit
your requirements. For more information, see the Build your own UI section.

## Objective

You'll learn how to:

- Install the cocmd SDK
- Initialize cocmd Client
- Pass the meeting object to UI Kit
- Go live!

## Before Getting Started

- Make sure you've read the [Getting Started with cocmd](/getting-started) topic
  and completed the following steps:
  - Create a [cocmd Developer Account](https://dev.cocmd.ai/)
  - Create [Presets](https://dev.cocmd.ai/roles-presets). cocmd also includes the
    following pre-configured presets for group call and webinar. You can simply
    use the default preset if you don't wish to create one.
    - webinar_viewer
    - webinar_presenter
    - group_call_host
    - group_call_participant
  - Create a [cocmd Meeting](/api/?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting)
  - [Add Participant](/api/?v=v2#/operations/add_participant) to the meeting
- Install [React 16.8](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html)
  or higher on your device
- Read the [Introduction to React Native UI Kit](/react-native) to understand the UI
  Kit and its relationship with web core SDKs.

## Step 1: Install the SDK

Since the UI Kit is built on top of the Core SDK, you must install the
`react-native-core` package along with the `react-native-ui-kit`.

`react-native-core` consists of hooks which makes it easy to use.

You can install the package using npm or Yarn.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @dytesdk/react-native-ui-kit @dytesdk/react-native-core
```

Install the required dependencies

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react-native-webrtc react-native-document-picker react-native-file-viewer react-native-fs react-native-safe-area-context react-native-sound-player react-native-svg react-native-webview
```

Install the following dependencies only if you need livestream.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react-native-gradle-plugin amazon-ivs-react-native-player
```

:::tip Import Errors

If you get errors when importing the `react-native-ui-kit` and `react-native-core`
packages, try installing them separately.

## Step 2: Get Started with cocmd Prebuilt Components

Here's a series of steps that you need to perform:

1. Set up `cocmdProvider`. You need it to import the `cocmdProvider` from the
   `dytesdk/react-native-core`. cocmdProvider basically is a hook wrapper on
   dytesdk/web-core. This provides a meeting object to child components.
2. Set up `cocmdUIProvider`. You need it to import the `cocmdUIProvider` from the
   `dytesdk/react-native-ui-kit`. This provides dyte design system to child components.
3. Initialize the cocmd client. Use the `usecocmdClient()` hook and `initMeeting`
   to initialize a client.
4. Call the `init()` method and pass the `authToken`:

|             |                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authToken` | After you've created the meeting, add each participant to the meeting using the [Add Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant). The API response contains the authToken. |

4. Pass the meeting object to UI Kit, which will use it to retrieve meeting
   information and display it on the user interface.

   The meeting object serves as the link between web-core and UI Kit, allowing
   them to communicate with one another. Once the UI Kit has the meeting object,
   it can join and leave meetings, and so on.

```jsx
import { usecocmdClient } from '@dytesdk/react-native-core';
import { cocmdUIProvider, cocmdMeeting } from '@dytesdk/react-native-ui-kit';

export default function App() {
  const [meeting, initMeeting] = usecocmdClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    initMeeting({
      authToken: '<auth-token>',
      defaults: {
        audio: false,
        video: false,
      },
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <cocmdProvider value={meeting}>
      <cocmdUIProvider>
        <cocmdMeeting meeting={meeting} />
      </cocmdUIProvider>
    </cocmdProvider>
  );
}
```

## Example: Using Prebuilt `cocmdMeeting` Component

In the following example, a meeting is created using the `usecocmdMeeting`
component. `usecocmdMeeting` essentially returns the meeting object you passed to
the `cocmdProvider`.

`cocmdMeeting` renders the entire meeting UI. It loads your preset and renders
the UI based on it. With this component, you don't have to handle all the
states, dialogs, and other smaller bits of managing the application.

For more information on the other props of `cocmdMeeting`, see
[cocmdMeeting](/react-native/components/dyte-meeting).

```jsx
function MyMeeting() {
  const { meeting } = usecocmdMeeting();

  return (
    <cocmdProvider value={meeting}>
      <cocmdUIProvider>
        <cocmdMeeting meeting={meeting} />
      </cocmdUIProvider>
    </cocmdProvider>
  );
}
```
